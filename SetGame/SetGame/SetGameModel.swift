//    A set consists of three cards satisfying all of these conditions:
//
//    They all have the same number or have three different numbers.
//    They all have the same shape or have three different shapes.
//    They all have the same shading or have three different shadings.
//    They all have the same color or have three different colors.
//    The rules of Set are summarized by: If you can sort a group of three cards into "two of ____ and one of ____", then it is not a set.
//
//    For example, these three cards form a set:
//
//    One red striped diamond
//    Two red solid diamonds
//    Three red open diamonds
//    Given any two cards from the deck, there is one and only one other cards that form a set with them.
//func cardsDoFormSet(cardOne:Card, cardTwo:Card, cardThree:Card) -> Bool {
//    return false // TODO
